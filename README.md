# Procedural-Planet-2

This is a proof-of-concept project to procedurally generate an icosphere made of multiple sub-meshes at a diameter of roughly 12,600km, or over 12 million meters, in Unity units. To avoid serious floating point errors, a special HyperPosition and HyperDistance math system was created to allow for accurate math in extremely high numbers. Development stopped when time for the project ran out and it was discovered that implementing HyperDistance division was far more difficult than expected.
